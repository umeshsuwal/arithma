## 📖 About

Arithma is a user-friendly web application designed to help students, educators, and professionals solve calculus problems. It provides a clean interface for calculating derivatives and integrals, making complex mathematical operations accessible to everyone.

## ✨ Features

- **Derivatives** - Calculate derivatives of various functions
- **Integrals** - Compute definite and indefinite integrals
- **Step-by-Step Solutions** - View the detailed solving process
- **Multiple Function Types** - Support for polynomial, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions
- **Interactive Interface** - User-friendly design for easy input of mathematical expressions
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🔍 Demo

Check out our [live demo](https://arithma-by-umesh.vercel.app/) to try Arithma right in your browser!

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Visit the application** in your web browser
2. **Select the operation** (derivative or integral)
3. **Enter your function** using standard mathematical notation
4. **Set parameters** if needed (e.g., integration limits)
5. **Click "Calculate"** to see the results
6. **View the step-by-step solution** to understand the process

### Example Functions

```
# Derivative examples
f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 2
f(x) = sin(x) * cos(x)
f(x) = e^(x^2) * ln(x)

# Integral examples
∫ x^3 dx
∫ sin(x) dx from 0 to π
∫ ln(x)/x dx
```

## 💻 Installation

To run Arithma locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/umeshsuwalit/arithma.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd arithma

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Math Processing**: MathJS/KaTeX
- **Visualization**: D3.js
- **UI Framework**: React/Vue.js

## 📚 How It Works

Arithma uses symbolic mathematics libraries to process and solve calculus operations:

1. **Parsing**: Mathematical expressions are parsed into syntax trees
2. **Symbolic Computation**: Rules of calculus are applied to compute derivatives and integrals
3. **Simplification**: Results are simplified for clear presentation
4. **Visualization**: Functions and their derivatives/integrals are rendered graphically
